## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

### Random Forest Regression

The project uses **Random Forest Regression** as the primary machine learning algorithm.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to produce a final prediction. It can capture complex and non-linear relationships between input features and the target production value.

### Target Variable

The model predicts:

**Coal/Lignite Production**

The application displays the predicted production in **million tonnes**.
